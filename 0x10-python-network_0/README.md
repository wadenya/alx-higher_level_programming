1. **What is a URL?**
   A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference or address used to access resources on the internet. It specifies the location of a web resource and the protocol for fetching it.

2. **What is HTTP?**
   HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring web pages on the internet. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to those messages.

3. **How to read a URL?**
   A typical URL might look like this: `http://www.example.com:8080/path/page.html?query=value#fragment`.
   - `http`: protocol or scheme
   - `www`: sub-domain
   - `example.com`: domain name
   - `8080`: port number (optional, if not specified, default is 80 for HTTP)
   - `/path/page.html`: path to a resource on the web server
   - `query=value`: query string (optional)
   - `#fragment`: fragment or anchor (optional)

4. **The scheme for a HTTP URL**
   For HTTP, it's "http". For its secure version (HTTPS), it's "https".

5. **What is a domain name?**
   A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify a specific location on the internet. For instance, "google.com" is a domain name.

6. **What is a sub-domain?**
   A sub-domain is a subset or a smaller part of the main domain. For instance, in the URL "blog.example.com", "blog" is a sub-domain of the main domain "example.com".

7. **How to define a port number in a URL?**
   It's specified after the domain name, separated by a colon. Example: `http://example.com:8080`. Here, `8080` is the port number.

8. **What is a query string?**
   A query string is a part of a URL that contains data to be passed to web applications, usually in the form of key-value pairs. It starts after a "?" symbol. Example: `http://example.com/path?name=value`.

9. **What is an HTTP request?**
   An HTTP request is a message sent by the client (usually a web browser) to the server, asking for a specific resource or performing an action like submitting form data.

10. **What is an HTTP response?**
    An HTTP response is the message sent by the server back to the client in reply to an HTTP request. It contains the requested resource or an error message.

11. **What are HTTP headers?**
    Both HTTP requests and responses contain headers. Headers provide metadata about the request or response, such as the type of web browser making the request, the type of data returned, etc.

12. **What is the HTTP message body?**
    It is the part of the HTTP message (request or response) that contains the actual data. In a request, this might be form data. In a response, it might be the HTML of a web page.

13. **What is an HTTP request method?**
    It indicates the desired action to be performed on the resource. Common methods include GET (fetch a resource), POST (submit data to a server), PUT (update a resource), DELETE (remove a resource).

14. **What is an HTTP response status code?**
    It's a three-digit number in the HTTP response that indicates the result of the request. Examples: 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error).

15. **What is an HTTP Cookie?**
    A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser. It can be used to remember information about the user between sessions.

16. **How to make a request with cURL?**
    cURL is a command-line tool used to make HTTP requests. Basic usage: `curl http://example.com`.

17. **What happens when you type google.com in your browser (Application level)?**
    - You enter `google.com` in the browser's address bar and hit Enter.
    - The browser checks its cache for a DNS (Domain Name System) record to find the IP address for `google.com`.
    - If not found in cache, the browser makes a DNS query to resolve the domain name to an IP address.
    - The browser establishes a TCP connection to the server located at that IP.
    - The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server asking for the web page.
    - The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the web page content.
    - The browser processes the received data, rendering the web page on your screen.

I hope this helps clarify things for you!
